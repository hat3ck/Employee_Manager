# Employee_Manager
This is a simple python code that manages employees and assigns a job using Python and SQL. Here's the full description: 
"Assume you have a pool of employees - each with a set number of available hours to do the jobs assigned to them - whenever a new job arrives - a job that has expected hours associated with it - you want to pick the minimum number of employees who can do the given job and create a trigger so that when the job is expected to finish - you check the status of the job and if it is indeed finished then you update the employee status (make them eligible for next jobs) otherwise in a scenario where no more additional hours available for the employee - then you add a new employee to the job. If a job arrives for which no employee is currently available, you keep the job in a queue and start such a job as soon as possible.
